************ BUSINESS GAME PLAN (Trend Following Bot) ************

* Define whether its going to be a day trader (14 day period) Position Trader (90 days or more) CURRENTLY SET TO 14 days
* Simplify Outputs, BEEF UP algorithm
* maintain a manual list of tickers
* pull categories of stocks from finnhub
* PHASE 1: 
    Technical Analysis
        Moving AVGs: Widely separated moving averages (e.g., 20 EMA and 50 EMA) suggest a trend., 
        ATR to measure volatility (High ATR = trending potential; Low ATR = likely mean-reversion.)
        ADX  (> 25 signals a strong trend, while < 20 indicates a weak trend)
        RSI (above 70 RSI means sell, under 30 RSI means buy) **ONLY use when confirmed by Moving AVGs 
        Volume-based filter to confirm breakouts/trend strength (Relative Volume > 1.5 often indicates strong participation)
    Fundamental Analysis:
        Low Price-to-Earnings (P/E): undervaluation compared to peers.
        High Earnings Growth: Companies with strong growth potential but little attention
        Low Debt-To-Equity Ratio: Financially stable companies with room to grow.

PHASE 2:
    BackTest on Historical Data
    Market Regime Detection (a way to identify market transition from trending to ranging e.g: Bollinger Bands or Mean-reversion)
    Dynamic Stop-Loss and Take Profit Levels: Use recent ATR or Volatility to set new risk/reward levels
    Multi-Timeframe Analysis
    Async.IO
    Fundamental Analysis:
        Insider Buying: Indicates confidence from management in future performance.
        MACD
        Bollinger Bands
    Technical Analysis:
        Consolidation Zones: Stocks trading sideways in a tight range, indicating accumulation by smart money.

* Send Text Messages of stocks to review but eventually auto buy and sell.
#TODO: review other endpoints from finnhub
*#TODO: ADD build devops features (auto schedule on github actions poetry, pre-configs clean ups etc)




#Trend-Following Bot

Why?
Simple to implement using basic indicators like moving averages, RSI, or MACD.
Doesn't require constant intervention.
How It Works: The bot identifies trends in the market and takes positions accordingly. For example, buying when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one.
Considerations:
Works best in trending markets.
Test and optimize with historical data to avoid false signals.


#Mean Reversion Bot

Why?
Suitable for range-bound assets with a history of reverting to the mean.
Easy to program using statistical measures (e.g., Bollinger Bands).
How It Works: The bot buys when prices drop below a predefined range and sells when they return to the average.
Considerations:
Best for stable, non-volatile markets.
Requires less frequent monitoring but regular strategy validation.

Here is a list of files typically necessary for building and managing a Python trading bot:

1. Main Bot File (e.g., main.py)
This is the core of your bot, where the main logic for the trading process runs. It might include functions for fetching data, executing trades, and managing the trading strategy.


2. Configuration File (e.g., config.py or config.json) ***
This file stores configuration settings such as API keys, account credentials, trading parameters (like risk management), and other adjustable settings for the bot.


3. Requirements File (requirements.txt)
This file contains a list of all external Python libraries and dependencies your bot needs (e.g., requests, pandas, numpy, ccxt, etc.).


4. Logging File (log.py)
This handles logging of events, such as trade executions, errors, or any other noteworthy bot activity. This could be configured with Python's logging module to output logs to a file or the console.


5. Data Retrieval File (e.g., data_fetcher.py)
This file contains functions to fetch data from external sources, such as stock or crypto exchanges (e.g., using APIs like yfinance, ccxt, or alpha_vantage).


6. Strategy File (e.g., strategy.py)
Contains the trading strategy or algorithm, defining the conditions for when to buy, sell, or hold assets. This might include technical indicators, risk management rules, etc.


7. Risk Management File (risk_management.py)
This file includes logic for managing trading risks such as setting stop losses, calculating position size, and handling margin calls or drawdowns.


8. Execution File (executor.py)
Handles trade execution by interacting with the broker or exchange's API. This file sends buy, sell, or other trade instructions to the exchange.


9. Testing / Backtesting File (backtest.py)
This file is used for testing the trading strategy using historical data. It helps simulate the strategy's performance before running it live.


10. Database/File Storage (e.g., database.py or data_storage.py)
This stores trade history, logs, and other data necessary for later analysis or record-keeping. Could be a local database (SQLite, MySQL) or cloud-based (AWS, Firebase).


11. Utility Files (e.g., utils.py)
Contains any utility functions used across the bot, such as date/time functions, data formatting, or logging utilities.


12. Scheduler File (scheduler.py)
If the bot needs to run at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or hour), this file helps schedule tasks using Pythonâ€™s schedule library or a cron job.

13. API Interaction File (e.g., api_client.py)
Contains classes and functions to interact with specific exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.), handling authentication, request/response, and error handling.
14. Test Files (e.g., test_bot.py, test_strategy.py)
These files are used for unit testing the individual components of the trading bot, ensuring that each part functions correctly.


15. Dockerfile (Optional)
If you want to containerize your bot for easy deployment, a Dockerfile will define the environment and setup for your bot to run inside a container.


16. README.md
A file that provides documentation about the project, including how to set it up, configure, and run the bot. It may also include trading strategy explanations and usage notes.
