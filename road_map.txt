Trend-Following Bot vs Mean Reversion Bot



#Trend-Following Bot

Why?
Simple to implement using basic indicators like moving averages, RSI, or MACD.
Doesn't require constant intervention.
How It Works: The bot identifies trends in the market and takes positions accordingly. For example, buying when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one.
Considerations:
Works best in trending markets.
Test and optimize with historical data to avoid false signals.

Combine RSA and Moving Averages to compare stocks
if RSA hit 70 in the past week and on the downward SELL, if it hit 30 in the past week and on the UPWARD buy


#Mean Reversion Bot

Why?
Suitable for range-bound assets with a history of reverting to the mean.
Easy to program using statistical measures (e.g., Bollinger Bands).
How It Works: The bot buys when prices drop below a predefined range and sells when they return to the average.
Considerations:
Best for stable, non-volatile markets.
Requires less frequent monitoring but regular strategy validation.

Here is a list of files typically necessary for building and managing a Python trading bot:

1. Main Bot File (e.g., main.py)
This is the core of your bot, where the main logic for the trading process runs. It might include functions for fetching data, executing trades, and managing the trading strategy.


2. Configuration File (e.g., config.py or config.json)
This file stores configuration settings such as API keys, account credentials, trading parameters (like risk management), and other adjustable settings for the bot.


3. Requirements File (requirements.txt)
This file contains a list of all external Python libraries and dependencies your bot needs (e.g., requests, pandas, numpy, ccxt, etc.).


4. Logging File (log.py)
This handles logging of events, such as trade executions, errors, or any other noteworthy bot activity. This could be configured with Python's logging module to output logs to a file or the console.


5. Data Retrieval File (e.g., data_fetcher.py)
This file contains functions to fetch data from external sources, such as stock or crypto exchanges (e.g., using APIs like yfinance, ccxt, or alpha_vantage).


6. Strategy File (e.g., strategy.py)
Contains the trading strategy or algorithm, defining the conditions for when to buy, sell, or hold assets. This might include technical indicators, risk management rules, etc.


7. Risk Management File (risk_management.py)
This file includes logic for managing trading risks such as setting stop losses, calculating position size, and handling margin calls or drawdowns.


8. Execution File (executor.py)
Handles trade execution by interacting with the broker or exchange's API. This file sends buy, sell, or other trade instructions to the exchange.


9. Testing / Backtesting File (backtest.py)
This file is used for testing the trading strategy using historical data. It helps simulate the strategy's performance before running it live.


10. Database/File Storage (e.g., database.py or data_storage.py)
This stores trade history, logs, and other data necessary for later analysis or record-keeping. Could be a local database (SQLite, MySQL) or cloud-based (AWS, Firebase).


11. Utility Files (e.g., utils.py)
Contains any utility functions used across the bot, such as date/time functions, data formatting, or logging utilities.


12. Scheduler File (scheduler.py)
If the bot needs to run at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or hour), this file helps schedule tasks using Pythonâ€™s schedule library or a cron job.


13. API Interaction File (e.g., api_client.py)
Contains classes and functions to interact with specific exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.), handling authentication, request/response, and error handling.
14. Test Files (e.g., test_bot.py, test_strategy.py)
These files are used for unit testing the individual components of the trading bot, ensuring that each part functions correctly.


15. Dockerfile (Optional)
If you want to containerize your bot for easy deployment, a Dockerfile will define the environment and setup for your bot to run inside a container.


16. README.md
A file that provides documentation about the project, including how to set it up, configure, and run the bot. It may also include trading strategy explanations and usage notes.
